# VineCorrupt
Archive of old VineCorrupt project

Not maintained since probably around 2015. Code is of dubious quality, but is just here for archival purposes. Code has not been modified since whenever I built v1.1 (unless I had changes that never got built into a potential v1.2).

Should work with MSVC 2022.

Related projects that this project relies on are:

- [mdcorrupt](https://github.com/Roughsketch/mdcorrupt) - The actual tool that does the corruptions. VineCorrupt is essentially just a GUI for this program.
- [mdgcm](https://github.com/Roughsketch/mdgcm) - Command line interface for extracting, building, and listing files from GameCube discs.
- [WIT](https://wit.wiimm.de/wit/cmd-extract.html) - A command line Wii disc extractor and builder.
